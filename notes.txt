In next.js, we may create a folder like this -> 'src/app/thisFolder/page.tsx'.
Then, and we may navigate to localhost:3000/thisFolder to see the page.
- Note that the name page.tsx is neccessary (much like index.tsx)

In 'src/app/layout.tsx' we can create layout that will apply to all pages

We may make a custom not found page under 'src/app/' the file name must be not-found.tsx

To custom loading page, we need to create a file call loading.tsx (put in 'src/app/' to make it global)

"use client";
// ! "use client"; is used to declare that this is a client component.
// ! need to be on the top most

We can also create an error page that may display when error occur.
To make it global, the error page will be put as ('src/app/error.tsx')
Or else, put in the same folder with the specific page that need to run with that specific error when error occur

In this example, we create a folder caled 'components' with a file call 'bootstrap.tsx'.
Then we destructure and export different components and use them in other files/pages
As seen in 'layout.tsx', we import {Container} from the components directory
- Note!! we declare "use client" in bootstrap.tsx, so this {Containner} component is count as client.
Then 'hello page' (hello folder) will be counted as 'client since it is in <Container></Container>

Check loading.tsx for the setup of loading animation
